Intro to Sockets

https://beej.us/ - good resource for socket APIs

Redis is a good ex. of server/client system.
Multiple clients connect to a single server,
server recieves TCP conns and sends responses

socket() -> return a fd
bind() -> associates an address to a socket fd
listen() -> enables us to accept conns to that addr.
accept() -> takes a listening fd, when a client makes a connection to the listening address, the accept() returns an fd that represents the connection socket.

Pseudo-code (server):
```
fd = socket()
bind(fd, address)
listen(fd)
while True:
    conn_fd = accept(fd)
    do_something_with(conn_fd)
    close(conn_fd)
```

read() -> recieves data from a TCP conn.
write() -> sends data
close() -> destroys the resource reffered by the fd and recycles the fd num

connect() -> takes a socket fd and address and makes a TCP conn to that addr

Pseudo-code (client):
```
fd = socket()
connect(fd, address)
do_something_with(fd)
close(fd)
```
