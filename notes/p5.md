Typically 3 ways to deal with concurrent conns in server-side
network programming:
forking, multi-threading, and event loops

Forking creates new processes for each client conn
Multi-threading use threads
Event loops uses polling and nonblocking IO, usually runs on a single thread

Pseudo-code for event loop:
```
all_fds = [...]
while True:
    active_fds = poll(all_fds)
    for each fd in active_fds:
        do_something_with(fd)

def do_something_with(fd):
    if fd is a listening socket:
        add_new_client(fd)
    elif fd is a client connection:
        while work_not_done(fd):
            do_something_to_client(fd)

def do_something_to_client(fd):
    if should_read_from(fd):
        data = read_until_EAGAIN(fd)
        process_incoming_data(data)
    while should_write_to(fd):
        write_until_EAGAIN(fd)
    if should_close(fd):
        destroy_client(fd)
```
